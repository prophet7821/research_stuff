This would involve collusion between players, coaches, umpires, and even owners. * **Why it's unlikely:** Major League Baseball has strict rules against this kind of activity, with severe penalties for those who violate them. There's also a lot at stake for teams and players involved, so fixing the game wouldn't make much sense from a purely economic standpoint. **2. The Odds Are Manipulated:** While not technically rigging the outcome, manipulating odds through betting schemes or other methods can create an unfair advantage. * **Why it's problematic:** This undermines the integrity of the sport by creating artificial outcomes based on outside influences rather than skill and fair play. **3.
