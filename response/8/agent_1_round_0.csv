Here are some constructive steps for dealing with such situations while maintaining personal integrity and respectfulness towards others (including yourself): 1) Reflect on Your Feelings - Understand why she bothers you so much; there might be underlying reasons contributing to these feelings like misunderstanding each other’s actions due to lack of clear communication. 2) Communicate Openly – If possible, try having an open conversation about how their behavior affects you in non-confrontational ways—perhaps they don't realize what impact certain behaviors may cause because people often communicate differently from person to person. Remember not everyone has control over being'selfish'. It would help clarify things between all parties involved instead focusing solely upon revenge as negative emotions usually escalates conflicts further downstream leading nowhere good either way!3).
