Some popular interrogation techniques include: * **Mirroring**: Reflecting the other person's words and tone back at them to create a sense of rapport and make them feel more comfortable opening up. * **Open-Ended Interviewing**: Asking questions that cannot be answered with a simple ""yes"" or ""no,"" encouraging the individual to elaborate on their responses. * **Controlled Disclosure**: Gradually revealing sensitive information over time, while maintaining control over the conversation. * **Coercion**: Using guilt, shame, or threats to force individuals into providing information. * **Blunt Assessment**: Presenting facts and figures without emotional appeal, often resulting in reluctant disclosures. **Why these techniques work:** These methods can",1,0.7
